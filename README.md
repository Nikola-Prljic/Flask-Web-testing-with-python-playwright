## How to run
make docker
now you can connect to 127.0.0.1/8001

For docker .env FLASK_DB_PORT should be 3307

If you have a MARIADB you can just use make and connect to it. But per default it will try port 3306

## useful cmds

use venv packages!

source .venv/bin/activate

mysql -P 3306 --protocol=tcp -u root -p
